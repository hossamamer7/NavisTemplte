# Summary
This project is to be used as a template for developers to create custom plugins to navisworks. So instead of everytime I create a navisworks plugin I need to set the debug configurations or the Post Build Event or any other repetitive stuff, I created this template so it will be easily edited and customized. 
It supports Navisworks versions 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and It will be continuously updated.

# Support Navisworks Version : 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.

# Guideline 
- You have to run the visual studio as an adminstrator so the files could be copied.
- You have to change the solution location in the Post Build Event.
